# Sui Indexer — Agent Instructions

## Scope

- This is a Rust **workspace** for a high-performance, modular **Sui blockchain indexer**.
- `bin/sui-indexer-cli` contains the production CLI binary (published as `sui-indexer`).
- `crates/` contains reusable library crates:
  - `sui-indexer-config` — configuration management & loading (TOML + env).
  - `sui-indexer-core` — orchestration (`IndexerCore`), Sui gRPC client integration.
  - `sui-indexer-events` — event-processing pipeline (`EventProcessor` trait, batch/filter/transformer).
  - `sui-indexer-storage` — PostgreSQL storage layer (`sqlx`), models, migrations.
- No frontend/web-framework assumptions. The indexer is a headless service.

## Execution Strategy

- Maximize parallelism by dispatching subagents aggressively and consuming tokens freely to complete tasks faster.

## Tool Usage & Commands

- **NEVER execute `cargo` commands in parallel.** Rust's cargo uses strict file locks on the `target/` directory.
- ALWAYS run `cargo check`, `cargo build`, or `cargo test` sequentially. Wait for one to finish before starting the next.
- When fixing errors, execute the file `Write`/`Edit` tool FIRST, wait for it to succeed, and only THEN run `cargo` commands to verify. Do not parallelize file edits with cargo builds.
- `sui-*` dependencies are **git dependencies** (MystenLabs/sui). A full `cargo build` pulls and compiles a large portion of the Sui monorepo — expect long builds. Prefer `cargo check --no-deps` and `cargo metadata --no-deps` for fast structural verification.

## Build Configuration

- Optional: add a `.cargo/config.toml` that wraps `rustc` with [kache](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/kache) to cache compilation artifacts and speed up incremental builds:

  ```toml
  [build]
  rustc-wrapper = "kache"
  ```

## Cargo Workspace Rules (Critical)

1. Never manually type dependency versions in `Cargo.toml`; use `cargo add`.
2. Add workspace-level dependencies with:

   ```bash
   cargo add <crate> --workspace
   ```

3. Add sub-crate dependencies with:

   ```bash
   cargo add <crate> -p <crate-name> --workspace
   ```

4. Root `[workspace.dependencies]` must use numeric versions only (git deps pin `rev`).
5. Root `[workspace.dependencies]` must not carry features by default; sub-crates enable the features they need.
6. Sub-crates must use `workspace = true` for `version`, `edition`, `license`, `repository`, `homepage`, `documentation`, `authors`, `rust-version`, and `readme`.
7. Every crate must opt into the shared lint set with `[lints] workspace = true`.

### Sui git dependency policy

- All `sui-*` crates resolve from the **same** `git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git"` source pinned to a single `rev`.
- The current pinned rev lives in `[workspace.dependencies]` as `sui-rev` (documentation only) and is repeated on every `sui-*` entry.
- When bumping the Sui SDK, update `rev` on **all** `sui-*` entries to the same commit so Cargo does not compile multiple copies of `sui-types`/`sui-sdk-types` (which would cause type-mismatch errors).
- Fetch the latest `main` rev with:

  ```bash
  git ls-remote https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git HEAD
  ```

## Preferred Dependencies

When introducing new dependencies, prefer these crates unless compatibility requires a different choice:

```
clap, config, eyre, proptest, serde, thiserror, tokio, tracing, tracing-subscriber,
sqlx, async-trait, scc, parking_lot, chrono, uuid, url, futures, pin-project, hex
```

Always use the latest stable version available on crates.io. Run `cargo add <crate> --workspace` to add dependencies — this automatically resolves to the latest version.

### Project-mandated exceptions

The Sui ecosystem SDK (`sui-sdk`, `sui-json-rpc-types`, `sui-rpc-api`, …) pulls in and is built around `reqwest` and `anyhow`. As a result this workspace **does** use `reqwest` (HTTP/gRPC transport) and `anyhow` (application-layer glue) even though they are commonly avoided in greenfield projects. New code should still prefer `eyre` for application errors and `thiserror` for library errors; reach for `anyhow` only where the Sui SDK API forces it.

## Engineering Principles

### Rust Implementation Guidelines

1. Error handling:
   - Application layer: `eyre`.
   - Library layer: `thiserror`.
2. Database (`sqlx`):
   - Prefer runtime queries (`sqlx::query_as`).
   - DB structs should derive `sqlx::FromRow`.
   - Avoid compile-time `sqlx::query!` macros by default.
3. Concurrency:
   - Prefer lock-free/container-first approaches (`scc`, `ArcSwap`).
   - Avoid `Arc<Mutex<T>>` when better alternatives are available.
4. Observability:
   - Logging: `tracing` only (never `println!`/`eprintln!` in library code).
   - CLI binary may use `tracing-subscriber` with env-filter / JSON formatting.
5. Configuration:
   - Use the `config` crate and external TOML files (see `config.example.toml`).
6. Safety:
   - Use `unsafe` only when strictly necessary and document the safety invariants.

### Key Design Principles

- Modularity: each crate is independently usable with clear boundaries (`config` → `events`/`storage` → `core` → `cli`).
- Performance: parallel event processing, async I/O via Tokio, PostgreSQL connection pooling.
- Extensibility: custom behavior via the `EventProcessor` trait and declarative TOML event filters.
- Type Safety: strong static typing across crate boundaries; minimal dynamic dispatch.

### Concurrency and Async Execution

- Prefer atomic types (`AtomicUsize`, `AtomicBool`, etc.) with explicit `Ordering` for simple shared state.
- Use `scc` for highly concurrent maps/sets; avoid `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>` and `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<...>>>` on hot paths.
- Prefer `parking_lot::{Mutex, RwLock}` over `std::sync` locks for synchronous locking.
- Release `std::sync::Mutex` and `parking_lot::Mutex` guards before hitting any `.await` point.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex` for locks that span across `.await` points.
- Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for CPU-bound work and blocking I/O.
- Batch work or use bounded worker patterns instead of spawning massive volumes of tiny Tokio tasks.
- Channel selection:
  - Async-to-Async: `tokio::sync::mpsc` / `tokio::sync::broadcast`
  - Sync/MPMC: `crossbeam-channel` or `flume`
  - Avoid `std::sync::mpsc`

### Memory and Allocation

- For binary server applications, configure `tikv-jemallocator` or `mimalloc` if profiling shows allocator pressure.
- Use `bytes::Bytes` / `bytes::BytesMut` for network buffers.
- For critical serialization hot paths, prefer `rkyv` or `zerocopy`; reserve `serde_json` for config and non-critical APIs.

### Tooling and Hot Paths

- Keep code clean under `clippy::pedantic`, `clippy::nursery`, and `clippy::cargo` (allowed overrides are configured in `[workspace.lints]`).
- Use `#[inline]` for tiny methods called in hot loops or on every request, especially across crate boundaries.
- Mark cold error paths with `#[cold]` and `#[inline(never)]` when it improves hot-path instruction locality.

### What to Avoid

- Incomplete implementations: finish features before submitting.
- Large, sweeping changes: keep changes focused and reviewable.
- Mixing unrelated changes: keep one logical change per commit.
- Multiple `sui-*` `rev` values in the same workspace (see Sui git dependency policy).

## Development Workflow

When fixing failures, identify root cause first, then apply idiomatic fixes instead of suppressing warnings or patching symptoms.

### Sui-specific gotchas

- Type identity across crates depends on a single `sui-types`/`sui-sdk-types` build. If you see opaque "expected `sui_types::…`, found `sui_types::…`" mismatches, check that every `sui-*` dependency shares the same `rev`.
- `sui-json-rpc-types::SuiEvent` is the canonical event type used throughout `sui-indexer-events`.

## Parallelization and Resource Utilization

- **Use as many subagents and as much token budget as needed** to complete tasks efficiently. Parallelize independent work aggressively and maximize context utilization. Spawn subagents for independent research, code exploration, and implementation tasks to reduce latency and improve throughput.

Use test-driven development for behavior changes:

- **Git Restrictions:** NEVER use `git worktree`. All code modifications MUST be made directly on the current branch in the existing working directory.
- drive implementation with failing crate-local unit tests and `proptest` properties in the affected crate,
- keep `proptest` in the normal `cargo test` loop instead of creating a separate property-test command,
- treat `cargo-fuzz` as conditional planning work rather than baseline template setup,
- after the inner loop is green, run `just mutation` (cargo-mutants) and fix any surviving mutants.

After each feature or bug fix, run:

```bash
just format
just lint
just test
just mutation
```

If any command fails, report the failure and do not claim completion.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests: colocate with implementation (`#[cfg(test)]`).
- Use `cargo test` as the TDD inner loop; write a failing test first, then implement the smallest change that makes it pass.
- Property tests: colocate `proptest` coverage with the crate logic it exercises so it runs through the ordinary `cargo test` path.
- Cover boundary conditions (empty inputs, zero values, maximum sizes) with explicit assertions.
- Mutation testing: run `just mutation` (cargo-mutants) and fix any surviving mutants to keep the mutation score high.
- Benchmarks: only plan or add Criterion when the scope includes an explicit latency SLA, throughput target, or known hot path in a specific crate.
- Fuzz tests: only plan or add `cargo-fuzz` when a crate parses hostile input, implements protocols, decodes binary formats, or contains meaningful `unsafe` code. The event transformer/filter crates are the most likely candidates.
- Integration tests: place in crate-level `tests/`.
- Add tests for behavioral changes and public API changes.

## Language Requirement

- Documentation, comments, and commit messages must be English only.
